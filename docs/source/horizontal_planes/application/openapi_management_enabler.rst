***************
Introduction
***************

The OpenAPI management enabler will be an API Manager that allows enablers that publish their APIs, to monitor the interfaces lifecycles and also make sure that needs of external third parties (including granted open callers), as well as applications that are using the APIs, are being met.

***************
Features
***************

The OpenAPI management enabler has the following features:

- **OpenAPI Publisher:** A collection of tools that API providers use to define their APIs. These tools are also responsible to generate API documentation, manage access and usage policies, and can aswell be used for testing-debugging purposes. Candidate technology (and most likely to be used) is Swagger.

- **OpenAPI Portal:** A community site that allows the intrested users access to documentation, tutorials, software development kits etc. It can also allow to manage subscription keys and obtain support from the API provider if needed. Candidate technology is WSO2 API Manager + WSO2 Identity Server or Swagger UI.

- **OpenAPI Gateway:** A server that acts as an API front-end, which receives API requests and passses them to the backend. Afterwards it returns the responses back to the requester. It can modify the requests and responses on the fly, and it can also provide the functionality to support authentication, authorization, security, audit and caching. Candidate technology is WSO2, Kong, KrakenD.
